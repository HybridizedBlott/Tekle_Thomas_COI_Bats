# **Investigating the role of the *COI* in developing distinct virome profiles across various genera of bat**

This is analysis involves pulling data from the NCBI nucleotide database via the entrez package, performing data cleaning/filtering, comparative training between Radial SVM and Random Forest models using a 10 - fold cross validation and finally a supervised clustering analysis using the most suitable machine learning model. 

This analysis sought to:
a) identify which classifier would be more appropriate for the main objective which is..
b) determining if the COI gene, a gene suggested to be associated with immunogenic factors, plays a part in developing distinct viral profiles in bat genera.
